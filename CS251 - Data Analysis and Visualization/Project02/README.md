Project 2 â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis and Transformations

Course: CS 251: Data Analysis and Visualization

Language: Python

Files: analysis.py, transformation.py, test_transformation.py

Description:
- This project extends the data analysis capabilities by implementing a Transformation class to perform geometric transformations such as translation, scaling, and rotation on datasets. The project involves applying these transformations to datasets like the Iris dataset and a 3D mystery dataset to uncover hidden patterns.

Topics Covered:
1. Matrix operations for data transformations
2. Implementation of translation, scaling, and rotation
3. Application of transformations to real-world datasets
4. Visualization of transformed data

How to Run:
- python test_transformation.py
