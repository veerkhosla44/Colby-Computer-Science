Project 4 â€“ Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Course: CS 251: Data Analysis and Visualization

Language: Python

Files: pca.py, data_transformations.ipynb

Description:
- In this project, students implement Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dimensionality of datasets. The project includes applying PCA to the Iris dataset and a dataset of celebrity face images (Eigenfaces) to identify principal components and reconstruct data.

Topics Covered:
1. Computation of covariance matrices
2. Eigenvalue and eigenvector analysis
3. Dimensionality reduction techniques
4. Data reconstruction using principal components

How to Run:
- Open the Jupyter notebook and execute the cells in order.
