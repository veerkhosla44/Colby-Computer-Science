Description:
This program uses DFS to determine whether a path exists between two rooms in a maze represented as a graph. The traversal is performed using a recursive approach and custom vertex state tracking.

Topics Covered:
1. Graph traversal using DFS
2. Reachability and path existence
3. Color marking with enum VertexColor
4. Custom adjacency list implementation
5. Manual graph construction

How to Run:
1. javac *.java  
2. java Homework8
