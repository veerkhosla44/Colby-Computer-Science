Project 2: Polynomials with a Custom Linked List

Course: CSE 41321

Language: Java

Files: Homework2.java, SinglyLinkedList.java

Description:
This program uses a custom singly linked list to represent polynomials. Each node in the list stores a coefficient, and its index implies the exponent. It includes functionality for displaying and evaluating the polynomial.

Topics Covered:
1. Custom linked list structure
2. Node rotation to preserve polynomial structure
3. Polynomial evaluation
4. List traversal and manipulation

How to Run:
1. javac Homework2.java SinglyLinkedList.java
2. java Homework2
