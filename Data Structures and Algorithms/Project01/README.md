Insertion Time Analysis with Arrays
Course: CSE 41321
Language: Java
Files: Homework1.java

Description:
This assignment benchmarks the performance of inserting elements into a Java array by creating a new array and shifting values on each insert. The array grows incrementally, and time per insertion is measured and printed across multiple readings.

Topics Covered:
1. Array manipulation
2. Time complexity analysis (O(n) insert)
3. Performance benchmarking with System.nanoTime()
4. Use of Random for insertion location and value

How to Run:
