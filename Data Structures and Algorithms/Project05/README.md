Project 5: Dynamic Hash Table with Chaining and Resizing

Course: CSE 41321

Language: Java

Files:
Homework5.java, ChainedHashTable.java, DuplicateKeyException.java,
KeyValuePair.java, SinglyLinkedList.java

Description:
This assignment implements a chained hash table with automatic resizing. It tracks load factor and resizes when a threshold is exceeded. Key operations include insertion, lookup, removal, and iteration over keys.

Topics Covered:
1. Chained hashing
2. Load factor management
3. Dynamic table resizing
4. Key iteration with custom iterator
5. Custom KeyValuePair and linked list support

How to Run:
1. javac *.java
2. java Homework5
