Course: CSE 41321

Language: Java

Files: Homework4.java, Stack.java, SinglyLinkedList.java

Description:
This program adds large integers represented as strings by simulating digit-by-digit addition using custom stack and linked list structures. It handles carry operations manually and prints the final result.

Topics Covered:
1. Stack-based computation
2. Manual digit parsing and addition logic
3. Handling overflow and carry
4. Linked listâ€“backed stack structure

How to Run:
