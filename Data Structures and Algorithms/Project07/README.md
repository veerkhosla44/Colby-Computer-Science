Description:
This assignment implements DFS for planning course schedules given prerequisite relationships. A topological sort is performed using color-marking during DFS and inserting courses in postorder into a list.

Topics Covered:
1. Depth-first search (DFS)
2. Graph traversal and coloring
3. Topological sorting
4. Hash-based set implementation
5. Custom graph and vertex-edge classes

How to Run:
1. javac *.java  
2. java DepthFirstSearch
