Overview:
- Created a sunset-over-water scene using modular functions, randomness, and Turtle graphics.

Key Concepts:
1. Function scaling with parameters
2. Randomized positioning for visual variation
3. Scene rendering using loops
4. Command-line toggle for day vs night

Extension:
- Randomly generates either a sunset or nighttime version, with randomized star/moon placement.
