CS333 - Project 1

Explores how C stores different data types in memory, how the stack is laid out, dynamic memory management, and the memory layout of structs. Ends with a task that shows how improper input handling can lead to memory issues.

Tasks:
- Task 1: Print byte layout of various data types
- Task 2: Inspect local variable layout on the stack
- Task 3: malloc/free behavior when free is missing
- Task 4: Struct memory layout depending on field order
- Task 5: Buffer overflow risk from long user input
