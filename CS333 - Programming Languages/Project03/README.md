CS333 - Project 3

Implements and tests a stack in C, plus some math and sorting programs. Also reimplemented the logic in Rust using similar structures.

Tasks:
- Task 1: Sort an array using custom logic (C)
- Task 2: Calculate factorials with arguments (C)
- Task 3: Full stack implementation with test suite (C)
- Task 4: Visualize memory layout using stack/heap pointers
- Rust: Translate key logic from C to Rust and test
