CS333 - Project 8

Parallelized a Benfordâ€™s Law digit frequency counter using 6 different pthread-based strategies, then reimplemented the same task in Rust using Rayon. Also compared timing results.

Tasks:
- Task 1: Six C versions of Benford's Law counter using various mutex/shared memory setups
- Task 2: Rust implementation with threading, timing, and histogram output
- Bonus: Visualization and performance analysis with `analysis.py`
