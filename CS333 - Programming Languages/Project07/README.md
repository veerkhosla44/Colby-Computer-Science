CS333 - Project 7

Benchmarked memory allocation and deallocation in C, using timers. Then built a Rust version to compare with C. Also detected garbage blocks in memory.

Tasks:
- Task 1a/1b: Allocation and timing with int, char, double
- Task 2: Rust allocation + deallocation with average timing
- Extra: Simulated garbage detection on heap
