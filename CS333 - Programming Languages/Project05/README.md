CS333 - Project 5

Built a generic linked list in C and used it with both integers and characters. Then implemented the same behavior in Rust and added extra tests.

Tasks:
- Task 1: Add/remove/search/print/clear nodes (C)
- Task 1.3: Use char type in same list logic
- Rust: Similar logic with generic types and ownership rules
