Course: CS 251: Data Analysis and Visualization

Language: Python

Files: linear_regression.py, linear_regression_normal.ipynb, linear_regression_qr_poly.ipynb

Description:
This project focuses on implementing and comparing different linear regression techniques, including the normal equation, QR decomposition, and polynomial regression. Students apply these methods to various datasets to assess their effectiveness and visualize the results.

Topics Covered:
1. Implementation of linear regression using the normal equation
2. QR decomposition for solving linear systems
3. Polynomial regression and overfitting analysis
4. Visualization and interpretation of regression results

How to Run:

Open the Jupyter notebooks and execute the cells in order.
