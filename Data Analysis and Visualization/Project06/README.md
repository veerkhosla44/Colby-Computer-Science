Project 6 â€“ Spam Classification Using KNN and Naive Bayes

Course: CS 251: Data Analysis and Visualization

Language: Python

Files: knn_classifier.py, naive_bayes_classifier.py, spam_classification.ipynb

Description:
In this project, students implement two supervised learning algorithms, K-Nearest Neighbors and Naive Bayes, to classify emails as spam or ham. The project uses the Enron email dataset and includes performance evaluation of the classifiers.

Topics Covered:
1. Implementation of KNN and Naive Bayes classifiers
2. Text preprocessing and feature extraction
3. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall
4. Comparison of classifier performance

How to Run:

Open the Jupyter notebook and execute the cells in order.
