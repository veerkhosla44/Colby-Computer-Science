Project 7 â€“ Neural Networks for Digit Classification

Course: CS 251: Data Analysis and Visualization

Language: Python

Files: rbf_network.py, mnist_classification.ipynb

Description:
This project entails implementing a Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Students train the network, evaluate its performance, and explore the impact of different parameters.

Topics Covered:
1. Implementation of RBF neural networks
2. Training and testing on the MNIST dataset
3. Analysis of network performance
4. Exploration of hyperparameter effects

How to Run:

Open the Jupyter notebook and execute the cells in order.
