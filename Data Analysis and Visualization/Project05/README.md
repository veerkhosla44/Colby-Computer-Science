Project 5 â€“ K-Means Clustering and Image Segmentation

Course: CS 251: Data Analysis and Visualization

Language: Python

Files: kmeans.py, image_segmentation.ipynb

Description:
This project involves implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm and applying it to both numerical data and image data for segmentation purposes. Students explore the effects of different initializations and the impact on clustering results.

Topics Covered:
1. Implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm
2. Application of clustering to 2D datasets
3. Image segmentation using color clustering
4. Analysis of clustering performance and initialization methods

How to Run:

Open the Jupyter notebook and execute the cells in order.
