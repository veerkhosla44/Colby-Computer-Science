# Colby Computer Science

Welcome to my collection of computer science projects from my courses at Colby College. This repository showcases my work across a range of courses, highlighting skills in programming, algorithms, machine learning, systems, and more. Colby's computer science curriculum is extremely project-heavy, emphasizing hands-on experience and the practical application of theory. Each course is organized into its own directory with relevant projects, assignments, and reports.

#### Courses

### CS151 - Computational Thinking

This course focuses on the fundamentals of programming and problem-solving. It introduces computational thinking concepts, algorithmic thinking, and the basics of coding. Projects range from simple algorithms to more complex applications, focusing on clarity, efficiency, and correctness.

**Key Topics:**
- Algorithm design and analysis  
- Problem-solving with code  
- Basic data structures  
- Functions and recursion  



### CS231 - Data Structures and Algorithms

This course dives into more advanced data structures and algorithms. It explores how to efficiently store and manipulate data, as well as how to analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms. The projects help solidify these concepts through hands-on programming.

**Key Topics:**
- Linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs  
- Sorting and searching algorithms  
- Recursion and dynamic programming  
- Complexity analysis (Big O notation)  



### CS251 - Data Analysis and Visualization

In this course, we explore the tools and techniques for analyzing and visualizing data. Projects range from implementing basic algorithms for data manipulation to using visualization libraries for presenting data insights. The course emphasizes practical skills for working with real-world datasets.

**Key Topics:**
- Data cleaning and processing  
- Statistical analysis and basic machine learning  
- Data visualization with tools like Matplotlib and Pandas  
- Exploratory data analysis  



### CS333 - Programming Languages

This course investigates the theory and practical implementation of programming languages. Topics include syntax, semantics, and the design of programming languages. The course also touches on how different languages handle memory management, concurrency, and type systems.

**Key Topics:**
- Programming language design and paradigms  
- Syntax and semantics  
- Memory management and garbage collection  
- Functional vs imperative programming  



### CS343 - Neural Networks

This course focuses on machine learning, with an emphasis on neural networks and deep learning. Projects involved building models from scratch, training and evaluating them, and applying them to real-world datasets. There was a strong emphasis on understanding how neural networks function internally.

**Key Topics:**
- Supervised and unsupervised learning  
- Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), ADALINE, and backpropagation  
- Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)  
- Transfer learning and model fine-tuning  
- Real-world datasets and experimental evaluation  



#### Repository Structure

The repository is organized by course, with each course folder containing:
- Source code  
- Reports and documentation  
- Supporting datasets or input files  
- Compiled outputs (if applicable)
