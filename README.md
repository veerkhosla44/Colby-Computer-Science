# Colby Computer Science

Welcome to my collection of computer science projects from my courses at Colby College. This repository contains my work from a variety of computer science classes, showcasing different aspects of programming, algorithms, machine learning, and more. Each course is organized into its own directory with relevant projects, assignments, and notes. Below is a brief overview of the courses included.

## Courses

### CS151 - Computational Thinking
This course focuses on the fundamentals of programming and problem-solving. It introduces computational thinking concepts, algorithmic thinking, and the basics of coding. Projects range from simple algorithms to more complex applications, focusing on clarity, efficiency, and correctness.

#### Key Topics:
- Algorithm design and analysis
- Problem-solving with code
- Basic data structures
- Functions and recursion

### CS231 - Data Structures and Algorithms
This course dives into more advanced data structures and algorithms. It explores how to efficiently store and manipulate data, as well as how to analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms. The projects help solidify these concepts through hands-on programming.

#### Key Topics:
- Linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs
- Sorting and searching algorithms
- Recursion and dynamic programming
- Complexity analysis (Big O notation)

### CS251 - Data Analysis and Visualization
In this course, we explore the tools and techniques for analyzing and visualizing data. Projects range from implementing basic algorithms for data manipulation to using visualization libraries for presenting data insights. The course emphasizes practical skills for working with real-world datasets.

#### Key Topics:
- Data cleaning and processing
- Statistical analysis and machine learning
- Data visualization with tools like Matplotlib and Pandas
- Exploratory data analysis

### CS333 - Programming Languages
This course investigates the theory and practical implementation of programming languages. Topics include syntax, semantics, and the design of programming languages. The course also touches on how different languages handle memory management, concurrency, and type systems.

#### Key Topics:
- Programming language design and paradigms
- Syntax and semantics
- Memory management and garbage collection
- Functional vs imperative programming

### CS343 - Machine Learning
In this course, I explored various machine learning techniques, including supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, and deep learning. Projects include building classifiers, tuning models, and working with real datasets. The course gives a strong foundation for applying machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems.

#### Key Topics:
- Linear regression and classification
- Neural networks and deep learning
- Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
- Transfer learning and fine-tuning pre-trained models
