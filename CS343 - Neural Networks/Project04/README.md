# Project 04: Transfer Learning

Explored using pre-trained models to classify new images with limited data. Focused on freezing model layers, customizing output layers, and fine-tuning.

### Concepts
- Pre-trained CNNs (e.g. ResNet)
- Freezing and unfreezing layers
- Custom classification heads
- Fine-tuning with new datasets

### Tasks
- Used PyTorch and torchvision to load and adapt pre-trained models
- Created a custom dataset of objects to classify
- Fine-tuned the model on the new dataset
- Evaluated accuracy and generalization
