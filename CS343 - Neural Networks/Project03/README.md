# Project 03: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Trained CNNs for image classification tasks. Focused on understanding convolution, pooling, and the structure of deeper neural networks.

### Concepts
- Convolutional layers and filters
- Max pooling
- Flattening and fully connected layers
- Training on image data

### Tasks
- Used PyTorch to build CNNs
- Trained on CIFAR-10 dataset
- Experimented with different architectures and hyperparameters
- Evaluated model accuracy and visualized performance
