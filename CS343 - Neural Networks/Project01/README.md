# Project 01: ADALINE and Logistic Regression

Implemented two basic classifiers: ADALINE (Adaptive Linear Neuron) and Logistic Regression. Focused on binary classification, learning rules, and visualizing decision boundaries.

### Concepts
- Gradient descent
- Identity vs. sigmoid activation
- Mean squared error vs. cross-entropy loss
- Binary classification

### Tasks
- Built both models from scratch using NumPy
- Trained on real-world datasets (e.g. ionosphere, old faithful)
- Visualized decision boundaries and accuracy over epochs
- Compared performance and loss behavior
